## 🎯 Goal

- Consolidate previous learning through focused re-study and repetition.
- Convert shaky areas into **Anki-ready flashcards** for long-term retention.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Focused on **re-study and repetition** of material already covered in earlier days.
- Reviewed core Linux/CLI concepts previously learned (commands, basic workflows, and mental models).
- Wrote and refined **flashcards** to reinforce recall:
  - short definitions (what a command/concept is)
  - “what does this do?” command interpretation
  - common flags and their meanings
  - quick examples to anchor usage

---

## 🔗 Key Cybersecurity Connections

- **Retention > exposure**
  - Knowing the basics under pressure matters more than having “seen it once”.
- **Speed and accuracy**
  - Repetition reduces command errors and improves incident/lab execution.
- **Mental models**
  - Turning concepts into cards forces clean, testable understanding (no vague “I kind of get it”).

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Avoiding passive review and keeping repetition **active** (recall-based).
- Selecting flashcard prompts that test real understanding instead of trivia.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The fastest improvements come from tightening fundamentals via recall:
  - command purpose
  - input/output expectations
  - the most useful options/flags
- Flashcards work best when they’re:
  - specific and testable
  - small enough to answer quickly
  - paired with one concrete example

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps

- Continue daily re-study blocks and keep cards consistent:
  - prioritize concepts that caused hesitation during labs
  - add “gotcha” cards (common mistakes + corrections)
- Use a short daily loop:
  - 15–20 minutes review
  - 10 minutes creating/updating cards based on gaps

---

## 💭 Reflection

This was a consolidation day. The win condition wasn’t new topics—it was making existing knowledge faster, cleaner, and more reliable.

---

## ✅ Lessons Learned

**What worked**
- Active recall + writing flashcards from the exact gaps I noticed.

**What broke**
- Temptation to keep consuming new material instead of reinforcing old.

**Why it broke**
- Novelty feels productive even when it doesn’t stick.

**Fix / takeaway**
- Keep repetition as a daily non-negotiable and let new content earn its place.
