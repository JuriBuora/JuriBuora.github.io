## 🎯 Goal
Strengthen foundational understanding of how networks and the web work, while improving my personal knowledge system to support long-term learning.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### Environment & Tooling
- Explored and learned key features of **Parallels Desktop**:
  - VM lifecycle management
  - Snapshots and rollback concepts
  - Resource allocation basics
- Set up **Obsidian** for daily use:
  - Installed and configured productivity plugins
  - Refined note structure and navigation
  - Invested time in making the system usable, not just installed

### Study & Practice (TryHackMe)
Completed the following rooms:
- **Packets & Frames**
- **Extending Your Network**
- **DNS in Detail**
- **HTTP in Detail**

---

## ✅ What Worked
- Parallels features are now less “magic” and more predictable
- Obsidian is becoming a thinking tool, not a dumping ground
- Seeing networking topics across multiple rooms reinforced patterns
- DNS and HTTP concepts started connecting to earlier network knowledge

---

## ❌ What Didn’t
- Obsidian setup consumed more time than expected
- Some concepts still feel theoretical without hands-on packet inspection
- Mental overload from too many related topics in one day

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Productivity tools only help once friction is removed
- Networking concepts make sense when seen as **flows**, not definitions
- DNS and HTTP are not isolated topics — they sit on top of everything else
- Repetition across different explanations improves retention

---

## ❓ Questions
- When should I move from theory-heavy rooms to packet-level analysis?
- How much Obsidian customization is “enough” before it becomes distraction?
- What networking concepts must be second nature before touching exploits?
