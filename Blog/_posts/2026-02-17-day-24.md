## 🎯 Goal

- Reinforce “general Linux” fundamentals with a practical focus on:
  - shell workflows (pipelines, redirection, grep/regex extraction)
  - file system operations (hidden files, safe directory removal)
  - basic shutdown troubleshooting (systemd stop delays)
- Keep progress aligned with the main cybersecurity plan without derailing into rabbit holes.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### 1) Set a focused 14-day “tools lane” micro-syllabus
I defined a small parallel track to support the main cybersecurity plan:
- daily short **bash/CLI** drills
- 2×/week **PowerShell** sessions (objects + logs)
- 2×/week **Python** sessions (parsing + automation)
- integration “mini-missions” (log triage style tasks)

### 2) Started Effective Shell as the re-study source
Set a high-ROI reading/practice order:
- Getting help (`man`, shell `help`)
- Thinking in pipelines + redirection
- `find`
- `grep` + regex extraction
- shell expansion / globbing (wildcards)

### 3) Investigated an Ubuntu shutdown delay (~1:30)
Noted that a ~**90 second** shutdown delay strongly suggests **systemd** waiting for a service stop timeout.

Quick next-step checks:
- reveal shutdown messages with **Esc** during shutdown
- inspect previous boot logs after reboot:
  - `journalctl -b -1 | grep -iE "timed out|stop job|A stop job|failed to stop"`
  - `journalctl -b -1 -p warning..alert`
  - `systemd-analyze blame | head -n 30`

### 4) Reviewed hidden files + safe deletion ladder
Hidden files:
- GUI: toggle hidden with **Ctrl+H** (Files / Nautilus)
- CLI: `ls -la`

Safe directory removal:
- empty dir: `rmdir /path/to/dir`
- recursive with prompt (safer): `rm -rI /path/to/dir` or `rm -ri /path/to/dir`
- move to Trash from terminal (recoverable): `gio trash /path/to/dir`
- dangerous: `rm -rf /path/to/dir` (avoid unless absolutely certain)

## 🔗 Key Cybersecurity Connections

- **Pipelines + redirection = log triage muscle**
  - Investigations are often: filter → extract → aggregate → save evidence.
- **systemd + journalctl = incident-grade visibility**
  - If I can’t read service failures/timeouts, I’m blind during outages or suspicious behavior.
- **Hidden files are where the interesting stuff lives**
  - `.ssh`, `.config`, histories: credentials, persistence hints, and user activity artifacts.
- **Safe deletion habits matter**
  - Mistakes with `rm -rf` are self-inflicted incidents; safer patterns reduce risk.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Mapping “it loads forever when shutting down” into a concrete diagnosis path (systemd stop timeout).
- Staying fast without defaulting to risky commands.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- A ~90-second shutdown delay commonly matches **service stop hang + systemd timeout**.
- The fastest way to identify the culprit is checking the **previous boot journal** (`-b -1`) for stop-job/timeouts.
- File operations have a safety ladder; use the safer rungs by default.

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps

- Continue Effective Shell study with deliberate practice:
  - write down 3 “daily commands” per chapter and run them on real directories/logs
- Run shutdown triage commands and capture the exact stop-job culprit (service name) for follow-up
- Build a tiny reusable bash snippet for evidence capture:
  - separate stdout/stderr into files
  - run a grep extraction
  - output counts + top offenders

## 💭 Reflection

Today’s work was fundamentals-heavy, but it directly increases speed and accuracy in labs and real investigations. Better CLI control reduces friction and prevents dumb mistakes under pressure.

---

## ✅ Lessons Learned

**What worked**
- Keeping the plan intact and adding a small “tools lane” instead of resetting everything.

**What broke**
- Confusion around shutdown delays without visibility.

**Why it broke**
- Missing habit: using the journal to identify systemd stop timeouts.

**Fix / takeaway**
- Treat system behavior as observable: use `journalctl -b -1`, isolate the service, then act.
