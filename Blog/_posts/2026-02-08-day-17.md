## 🎯 Goal

Understand how **HTTP authentication works in practice**, focusing on:

- how browsers prove user identity
- what servers actually trust
- how cookies, headers, and parameters define trust boundaries

The objective was to move beyond theory and observe **real session behaviour** in a live web application.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### 🌐 Target Selection

Used the **AltoroJ (IBM TestFire) demo application**, a deliberately vulnerable Java web app.

Why this target:
- supports login and logout
- uses server-side sessions
- exposes clear cookie-based authentication behaviour

Deleting the session cookie reliably broke authentication, confirming correct target choice.

---

### 📡 HTTP Request Headers Analysis

Inspected the main document request using browser DevTools.

Identified and classified request headers:

#### Identity
- `Cookie`  
  - The only header representing authenticated identity

#### Context
- `Host`
- `Referer` (when present)
- `Origin` (when present)

#### Client Fingerprinting
- `User-Agent`

This clarified that **only cookies identify the user**, while other headers merely describe context or client properties.

---

### 🔁 HTTP Response Headers Observation

Reviewed server responses for security-relevant behaviour.

Observed:
- `Content-Type` defining how the browser interprets responses

Not observed in this response:
- `Set-Cookie`
- explicit security headers (e.g. CSP, HSTS)

Learned that `Set-Cookie` headers are typically sent only during:
- session creation
- login
- logout

Not seeing them on every response is normal.

---

### 🍪 Cookie and Session Behaviour

Identified the session cookie:

- **Name:** `JSESSIONID`
- **Purpose:** Links client requests to a server-side session

Flags observed:
- `Secure`
- `HttpOnly`
- no `SameSite` attribute

Key experiment:
- Deleting `JSESSIONID` immediately logged the user out

This demonstrated that **possession of the session cookie equals authenticated identity**.

---

### 🔧 Parameters and Client Control

Observed GET parameters in URLs and modified them manually.

Findings:
- Parameters are fully client-controlled
- Server responses changed based on parameter values

This reinforced that **any parameter trusted for authorization decisions can become a vulnerability**, leading to issues such as IDOR or logic flaws.

---

## 💡 Key Cybersecurity Connections

Today reinforced several core security concepts:

- HTTP is stateless; identity is reconstructed on every request
- Servers trust client-side tokens (cookies) for authentication
- Headers are mostly contextual, not security guarantees
- Parameters represent a major trust boundary

These concepts underpin vulnerabilities such as:
- session hijacking
- CSRF
- IDOR
- authentication bypass

---

## 🚧 Challenges

- Distinguishing request headers from response headers
- Avoiding assumptions about when cookies should appear
- Interpreting modern web behavior without classic form submissions
- Understanding which headers actually matter for security

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Authentication is not about passwords, but about trusted tokens
- Cookies are automatically sent and implicitly trusted
- Deleting a cookie is a definitive test of session control
- Security failures often stem from incorrect trust assumptions, not broken crypto

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Explore CSRF attacks based on cookie trust
- Study IDOR vulnerabilities through parameter manipulation
- Repeat this analysis using Burp Suite for clearer visibility
- Continue building web security mental models before exploitation

---

## 📌 Reflection

Today marked a shift from learning tools to understanding **trust boundaries**.

Seeing authentication fail by simply deleting a cookie made it clear how fragile web identity really is. This lab connected abstract HTTP concepts to real security consequences and set the stage for deeper web exploitation topics.

---

## 🧩 Lessons Learned

**What worked**
- Using a deliberately vulnerable application
- Proving session behavior through direct experimentation

**What broke**
- Expecting login to always create new cookies
- Expecting security behavior to be visible in every response

**Why it broke**
- Modern applications often reuse sessions
- Authentication state is frequently tracked server-side

**Fix / takeaway**
- Focus on behavior, not assumptions
- Possession of a trusted token equals identity
- Understanding trust boundaries is more important than tools
