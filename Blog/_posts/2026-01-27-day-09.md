## 🎯 Goal

Get comfortable navigating and interrogating a Linux system using core terminal commands, instead of blindly copy-pasting.

## ✅ What I Did

- Completed **TryHackMe – Linux Fundamentals Part 1**  
    👉 [https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1)
    
- Practiced essential Linux commands:
    
    - User identification
        
    - File and directory navigation
        
    - File content inspection
        
    - Searching files and strings
        
    - Basic shell operators
        
- Made deliberate mistakes (wrong paths, wrong grep syntax) and corrected them by inspecting the filesystem instead of guessing.

## 🧪 Commands Practiced

### Identity & Output

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`whoami`|Show current logged-in user|
|`echo`|Output text to stdout|

`tryhackme@linux1:~$ whoami`

---

### Navigation & File Discovery

|Command|Full Name|
|---|---|
|`ls`|list|
|`cd`|change directory|
|`pwd`|print working directory|
|`cat`|concatenate|

`ls cd Pictures pwd`

- Learned that directory names with spaces require quotes:
    

`ls "Important Files"`

---

### Viewing File Contents

- Used `cat` to read text files directly
    
- Understood why dumping large files blindly is a bad idea (future: `less`, `head`, `tail`)
    

---

### Finding Files

- Located files by name:
    

`find -name passwords.txt`

- Used wildcards:
    

`find -name "*.txt"`

---

### Searching File Contents with `grep`

- Searched logs for specific strings:
    

`grep 'THM' access.log`

- Learned correct vs incorrect syntax:  
    ❌ `grep THM* access.log`  
    ✅ `grep 'THM' access.log`
    

---

### Recursive Searching

- Searched across directories:
    

`grep -R 'THM' /home/tryhackme/`

---

## 🧠 Shell Operators Learned

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`&`|Run command in background|
|`&&`|Run second command only if first succeeds|
|`>`|Redirect output (overwrite)|
|`>>`|Redirect output (append)|

Examples:

`command1 && command2 echo "log" > file.txt echo "more" >> file.txt`

---

## ✅ What Worked

- Navigating directories logically instead of guessing paths
    
- Using `ls` before `cd` (basic, but critical)
    
- Understanding **why** grep failed instead of retrying randomly
    
- Seeing how small commands chain together into real workflows
    

---

## ❌ What Didn’t

- Initial misuse of `grep` wildcards
    
- Attempting to `cd` into directories without confirming they exist
    
- Underestimating how strict Linux is with syntax
    

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Linux doesn’t forgive assumptions — inspect first
    
- Wildcards are powerful but dangerous if misunderstood
    
- `grep` is foundational for log analysis and forensics
    
- Command-line literacy is non-negotiable in cybersecurity
    

---

## ❓ Questions

- When should `grep` be combined with other tools (`awk`, `sed`)?
    
- What are safe ways to inspect very large files?
    
- At what point does scripting replace manual command chains?

## 📌 One-Sentence Summary

Linux becomes manageable the moment you stop guessing and start interrogating the system methodically.
