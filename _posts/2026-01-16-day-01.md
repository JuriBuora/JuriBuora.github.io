## 🎯 Goal
Build a clean, reproducible cybersecurity lab and a unified knowledge system to support long-term learning and documentation.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### Virtualization & Environment
- Installed and configured **Parallels Desktop Pro**
- Created and verified the following virtual machines:
  - Windows 11
  - Kali Linux
  - Ubuntu Linux
- Considered (not yet installed) a **Windows Server VM**

### Knowledge Management
- Installed **Obsidian**
- Enabled synchronization across all devices
- Created a single root folder:

Cybersecurity/
├── Labs
├── Daily
├── GitHub Portfolio
├── Reports
├── Templates
├── Useful
└── Screenshots

### Kali Linux – Initial Operations
- Updated and cleaned the system:
  - `sudo apt update`
  - `sudo apt full-upgrade -y`
  - `sudo apt autoremove -y`
- Reviewed software installation methods:
  - APT (official repositories)
  - Snap / Flatpak / AppImage

### Accounts Created
- TryHackMe → https://tryhackme.com
- GitHub → https://github.com

---

## ✅ What Worked
- Parallels runs all VMs smoothly on macOS
- Kali Linux is stable and ready for labs
- Obsidian folder structure feels scalable and clean
- Understanding install methods reduced blind copy-pasting

---

## ❌ What Didn’t
- Software installation methods feel fragmented
  - APT (official repositories)
  - Snap / Flatpak / AppImage
- Still unclear when containers are preferable to native installs

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Environment setup is a **force multiplier**, not busywork
- Kali should remain lean; not every tool belongs system-wide
- Documentation matters as much as execution
- Doing this properly once prevents chaos later

---

## ❓ Questions
- When does a Windows Server VM become truly necessary?
- When should Docker/Podman be preferred over native installs?
- What tools should always exist on Kali vs installed per lab?

### Personal Objective (Why This Exists)

- ⬜ Transition into a **remote-capable cybersecurity role**
    
- ⬜ Build habit of **continuous learning and documentation**
    
- ⬜ Within **5–7 months**:
    
    - Complete and document **≥15 penetration tests**
        
    - Identify and fix real vulnerabilities
        
    - Be **junior-level hireable**, not “enthusiastic but useless”
