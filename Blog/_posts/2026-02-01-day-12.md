# ✅ DAY 12 CHECKLIST (SYSTEMATIC)

## 🧩 BLOCK 1 — Linux Filesystem & Navigation (Ubuntu VM)

⏱ ~45–60 min

### Tasks

-  Log into **Ubuntu VM**
    
-  Open terminal
    
-  Navigate from `/` to your home directory **without using the mouse**
    
-  Create the following structure:
    
    `~/day12/   ├── logs/   ├── scripts/   └── notes/`
    
-  Create 3 files using **different methods**:
    
    - `touch`
        
    - `echo >`
        
    - text editor (`nano`)
        
-  Inspect file types using `file`
    
-  Delete one file **safely** (not `rm -rf` blindly)
    

### Comprehension Questions (answer without notes)

1. What is the difference between **absolute** and **relative** paths?
    
2. Why is `/tmp` writable by everyone, and why is that dangerous?
    
3. What happens if you `rm` a file you don’t own?
    
4. Trick: Why might `rm -R folder` succeed where `rm folder` fails?

## 🧩 BLOCK 2 — Permissions & Users (Ubuntu VM)

⏱ ~45 min

### Tasks

-  Create a file: `secret.txt`
    
-  Set permissions to:
    
    - owner: read/write
        
    - group: read only
        
    - others: no access
        
-  Verify permissions with `ls -l`
    
-  Change permissions using **numeric notation**
    
-  Switch user with `su` (if available) or reason through it
    

### Comprehension Questions

1. What does `chmod 640 file` **actually mean**?
    
2. Why is `777` almost always a bad idea?
    
3. What is the difference between **ownership** and **permissions**?
    
4. Trick: Can a file be executable but not readable?

## 🧩 BLOCK 3 — Searching & Log Analysis (Ubuntu VM)

⏱ ~45 min

### Tasks

-  Locate log files in `/var/log`
    
-  Pick ONE log file (e.g. `auth.log` or `syslog`)
    
-  Use:
    
    - `grep`
        
    - `grep -R`
        
-  Search for:
    
    - failed logins
        
    - ssh-related entries
        
-  Redirect output to a file
    

### Comprehension Questions

1. Why is `grep` critical in incident response?
    
2. What’s the danger of using wildcards incorrectly?
    
3. Difference between `>` and `>>` in forensic work?
    
4. Trick: Why is dumping a whole log with `cat` often a bad idea?
    

---

## 🧩 BLOCK 4 — SSH & Networking Flow (Kali → Ubuntu)

⏱ ~45–60 min

### Tasks

-  From **Kali**, SSH into **Ubuntu**
    
-  Transfer a file using `scp`
    
-  Serve a file using:
    
    `python3 -m http.server`
    
-  Download it from the other VM using `wget`
    

### Comprehension Questions

1. What is encrypted when using SSH?
    
2. What port does SSH use by default, and why?
    
3. What happens if DNS fails but IP works?
    
4. Trick: Why is Python’s HTTP server dangerous if exposed publicly?
    

---

## 🧩 BLOCK 5 — Mental Model Drill (NO TERMINAL)

⏱ ~30 min

### Tasks

-  Close all terminals
    
-  On paper or Obsidian, write **from memory**:
    
    - What happens when you type a URL
        
    - Where DNS fits
        
    - Where TCP fits
        
    - Where HTTP fits
        
-  Draw a **simple flow diagram** (boxes + arrows)
    

### Comprehension Questions

1. Where can a firewall block traffic in this flow?
    
2. Where does a WAF sit?
    
3. Where would packet capture see plaintext vs encrypted data?
    
4. Trick: Can HTTP exist without TCP?
