## 🎯 Goal
Polish my GitHub Pages website, troubleshoot Jekyll environment issues, and consolidate past days’ notes for publication.

## ✅ What I Did

### Website & Blogging
- Attempted to add themes in Jekyll
- Encountered website breakage due to version incompatibilities
- Formatted notes from previous days to be ready for publication

### Troubleshooting Environment Issues
- Identified multiple conflicting Jekyll, Ruby, and package manager versions
- Observed VS Code losing GitHub integration (no commit/pull/push buttons)
- Discovered multiple PATH conflicts from remnants of RVM, chruby, ruby-build, .rubies, and rbenv
- Tried rolling back to previous versions, with partial success but new incompatibilities emerged

### Cleaning & Reinstalling
- Backed up `.zshrc`
- Used a cleanup script to remove all Ruby version managers and duplicate PATH entries
- Reinstalled Jekyll and Ruby, ensuring correct versions and consistent PATH setup
- Updated `.zshrc` to the following working configuration:


```zsh
# === Homebrew first ===
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:$PATH"

# === rbenv setup ===
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"

# Initialize rbenv
if command -v rbenv >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
fi

# Deduplicate PATH
typeset -U PATH```
```

- Verified Jekyll, VS Code, and GitHub integration now working smoothly

## ✅ What Worked

- Cleanup script successfully removed all conflicting Ruby managers
- Correctly configured `.zshrc` eliminated PATH duplication issues
- VS Code GitHub integration fully restored
- Jekyll site builds and runs locally without errors

---

## ❌ What Didn’t

- Initial attempt to add themes broke the website
- Version mismatch issues consumed hours of troubleshooting
- ChatGPT guidance was sometimes misleading on PATH and version issues
- Complexity of Ruby/Jekyll/Homebrew ecosystem exposed gaps in prior understanding

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Version management matters: multiple version managers can conflict disastrously
- PATH pollution is a real problem—cleaning `.zshrc` and deduplicating PATH is crucial
- Backup configuration files before experimentation
- Debugging environment issues can be more time-consuming than actual development
- Persistent troubleshooting and methodical approach eventually resolve complex conflicts

---

## ❓ Questions

- How can I prevent future version conflicts when experimenting with Jekyll or Ruby?
- Are there simpler workflows for managing Ruby and Jekyll versions on macOS?
- How much of the environment complexity is unavoidable vs. preventable?
