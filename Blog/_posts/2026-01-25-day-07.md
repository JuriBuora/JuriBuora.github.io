## 🎯 Goal
Reduce daily workflow friction and stabilize my GitHub Pages blog after repeated theme and configuration issues.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### 🖱️ Workflow Ergonomics
- Installed **AutoRaise** on macOS  
  - Enabled *focus-follows-mouse* behavior (Linux-style)
  - Windows automatically gain focus when hovering
  - Improved multitasking across terminal, editor, and browser

### 🌐 GitHub Pages & Jekyll Work (Jan 25, 2026)

Multiple commits focused on fixing structural and configuration issues:

- Fixed recurring **syntax errors in `header.html`**
- Modified `_config.yml` several times:
  - Header & footer
  - Social links
  - Tests
- Added and tested a **custom logo**
- Modified:
  - `README.md`
  - Existing posts
  - Test posts
- Removed **Minima** theme
- Switched to a **static theme**
- Changed theme to **`jekyll-theme-leap-day`**
- Added social usernames:
  - Twitter
  - LinkedIn
  - Facebook
- Modified:
  - `Gemfile`
  - About page
  - Theme layout files
- Added blog posts from previous days
- Iterated repeatedly to fix breakages caused by theme switches

---

## ✅ What Worked
- AutoRaise noticeably improved daily usability and focus
- Switching away from Minima unlocked more layout control
- Repeated exposure to Jekyll configs improved understanding
- Incremental commits helped isolate some breaking changes

---

## ❌ What Didn’t
- Header syntax errors resurfaced multiple times  
  → shaky understanding of Liquid + HTML interaction
- Theme switching caused cascading failures
- Too many changes per session slowed debugging
- Some commits were reactive rather than planned

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Ergonomics directly impact learning efficiency
- Jekyll themes are **opinionated systems**, not skins
- Blog infrastructure **is part of the skillset**
- Chaos is normal early — but must be reduced over time

---

## ❓ Questions
- What’s the best way to validate Liquid + HTML before committing?
- Should the theme now be frozen to avoid churn?
- When does local Jekyll testing become mandatory rather than optional?

---

## 🧩 One-Sentence Summary
Today was about smoothing my workflow and wrestling GitHub Pages into a stable state—painful, but essential groundwork.
