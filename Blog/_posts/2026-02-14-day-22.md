## 🎯 Goal

- Strengthen core Linux CLI skills by practicing download + file output handling.
- Build a clean mental model of **stdout (standard output)** vs **stderr (standard error)** and validate results with inspection commands.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Practiced using `wget` to fetch a webpage and save it locally (`index.html`, `test.html`).
- Reviewed stdout vs stderr behavior and how redirection affects what gets shown on screen vs written to files.
- Redirected errors into a file using:
  - `2> errors.txt` (stderr only)
- Verified output files using `wc`:
  - `wc -c test.html errors.txt` to measure file sizes (bytes)
  - `wc -l test.html` to confirm line counts

---

## 🔗 Key Cybersecurity Connections

- **Controlled output matters**
  - Separating normal output from errors is a baseline skill for log triage and reliable automation.
- **Reproducibility**
  - Saving output to files makes it auditable (useful for incident notes and evidence capture).
- **Signal vs noise**
  - stderr often contains the “why it failed” details; capturing it prevents missed root causes.
- **Basic validation**
  - `wc` gives quick integrity checks: did I actually download content? did I capture errors?

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Keeping the mental model clean for:
  - what goes to stdout
  - what goes to stderr
  - what stays on-screen vs what is redirected into files

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Redirection is about **file descriptors**, not “types of messages”:
  - stdout and stderr are separate streams and can be handled independently.
- `wc` gives fast, reliable checks:
  - `-c` = bytes (quick “did I get something non-empty?” check)
  - `-l` = lines (quick “does this match expected text structure?” check)

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps

- Practice combined redirection patterns:
  - capture both stdout + stderr to a single file
  - capture stdout to a file while still seeing stderr on screen (and vice versa)
- Build a tiny bash snippet that:
  - downloads a URL
  - writes stdout/stderr separately
  - verifies output sizes and exits non-zero on failure

---

## 💭 Reflection

Today was fundamentals work, but it’s the kind that prevents dumb mistakes later. Better control of output streams makes every future lab, script, and troubleshooting session cleaner and faster.

---

## ✅ Lessons Learned

**What worked**
- Using small commands (`wget`, `wc`) to build a clear mental model of outputs.

**What broke**
- Initial confusion over what gets displayed vs redirected.

**Why it broke**
- Mixing “terminal output” with “stdout/stderr streams”.

**Fix / takeaway**
- Always think in streams first (stdout/stderr), then decide where each should go (screen vs file).
