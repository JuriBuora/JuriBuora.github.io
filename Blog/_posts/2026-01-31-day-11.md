## 🎯 Goal

Finish **Linux Fundamentals Part 3** and understand how Linux systems are actually managed day-to-day (editors, processes, services, automation, logs).

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Completed **TryHackMe – Linux Fundamentals Part 3**
    
- Connected to target machine via **SSH**
    
- Used **Nano** to create and edit files
    
- Learned **VIM** exists and will eventually hurt me
    
- Downloaded files using `wget`
    
- Transferred files using `scp`
    
- Served files via:
    
    `python3 -m http.server`
    
- Inspected running processes with:
    
    `ps ps aux top`
    
- Managed services using `systemctl`
    
- Backgrounded and foregrounded processes (`&`, `Ctrl+Z`, `fg`)
    
- Created scheduled tasks using **cron**
    
- Learned how **APT repositories** and **GPG keys** work
    
- Explored system and service logs in `/var/log`
    

---

## ✅ What Worked

- SSH access and AttackBox workflow
    
- Python HTTP server for quick file hosting
    
- `systemctl` finally clicked conceptually
    
- Cron syntax makes sense with generators
    
- Logs clearly show why Linux is admin-friendly
    

---

## ❌ What Didn’t

- `wget` failed multiple times due to wrong URLs / inactive servers
    
- SSH connection errors early on (IP/availability issues)
    
- Still slow reading `ps aux` output efficiently
    
- Vim remains hostile territory
    

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Linux administration ≠ just commands, it’s **process control**
    
- `systemd`, cron, and logs are **core sysadmin knowledge**
    
- Backgrounding processes is a real productivity tool
    
- Logs are critical for both **defense and offense**
    
- Package management is about **trust**, not convenience

## ❓ Questions

- When should I switch from Nano to Vim seriously?
    
- What logs matter most during incident response?
    
- How deep should cron knowledge go before scripting takes over?
