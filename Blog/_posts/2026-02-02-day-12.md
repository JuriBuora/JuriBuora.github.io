## 🎯 Goal

Understand how Linux handles files and permissions at a fundamental level, and build safe, repeatable habits around destructive commands and log inspection.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### Files & Directories

- Created directory structures using **brace expansion**
    
- Created multiple files at once using `touch` and numeric ranges
    
- Practiced navigating with **absolute vs relative paths**
    
- Used `pwd` intentionally before running destructive commands
    

### Permissions & Ownership

- Studied **ownership vs permissions** (user, group, others)
    
- Learned how Linux evaluates permissions (owner → group → others)
    
- Understood **chmod in octal** as bit math, not memorization
    
- Created files with restricted permissions (e.g. `640`, `600`)
    
- Explored why **`777` is almost always a bad idea**, and when it is (rarely) acceptable
    
- Learned that a file can be **executable but not readable**
    

### Safety & Destructive Commands

- Broke down `rm -rf *` into its components and risks
    
- Understood how shell expansion (`*`) works
    
- Learned safer directory cleanup with:
    
    ```bash
    find . -mindepth 1 -delete
    ```
    
- Understood why filenames starting with `-` break commands and how to handle them safely
    

### Logs & Inspection

- Explored `/var/log` and identified relevant log files
    
- Focused on authentication and SSH-related logs
    
- Used **grep** and **grep -R** to search log entries
    
- Redirected grep output to files for later analysis
    

---

## ✅ What Worked

- Octal permissions finally clicked once viewed as **bit-level logic**
    
- Using absolute paths removed ambiguity and prevented mistakes
    
- `find -delete` felt safer and more intentional than `rm -rf *`
    
- `grep` proved extremely effective for log inspection
    
- Redirecting output made investigations repeatable
    

---

## ❌ What Didn’t

- Accidentally created files with problematic names (e.g. starting with `-`)
    
- Initially confused file ownership with delete permissions
    
- Over-trusted relative paths during early experiments
    

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Linux permissions are deterministic, not mystical
    
- Directories control deletion, not files
    
- Ownership selects which rule set applies; permissions define the rules
    
- Absolute paths remove dangerous assumptions
    
- `777` removes security boundaries instead of fixing problems
    
- Logs are the ground truth of system activity

## ❓ Questions

- When should `find -delete` be preferred over `rm -rf` in scripts?
    
- Which log files matter most first during incident response?
    
- At what point do permission misconfigurations become real security vulnerabilities?
