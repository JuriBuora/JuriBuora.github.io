## 🎯 Goal
Understand how a website works end-to-end, from the user’s device to the server response, and reinforce this understanding through visual mapping.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### Study & Practice
- Completed TryHackMe room: **How Websites Work**
- Completed TryHackMe section: **Putting It All Together**

### Consolidation & Reflection
- Reviewed and consolidated notes in Obsidian:
  - The Basics of Cybersecurity
  - Web fundamentals
  - Network fundamentals
- Re-read the **“Putting It All Together”** section slowly, focusing on flow rather than definitions
- Created a **large visual diagram in Apple Freeform** connecting most of the concepts studied so far  
  - This took significant time
  - Actively exposed gaps and weak spots in understanding
  - Forced clarification of relationships between concepts

---

## ✅ What Worked
- Visualizing the full flow made abstract concepts concrete
- Drawing connections highlighted missing or misunderstood steps
- Revisiting notes *after* hands-on study improved retention
- Slowing down instead of rushing new material paid off

---

## ❌ What Didn’t
- Some protocol-level details are still fuzzy without packet-level analysis
- The diagram became complex quickly, requiring pruning and simplification
- Explaining the full flow verbally is still harder than recognizing it visually

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- A website load is a **sequence of dependent processes**, not a single action
- DNS resolution is a prerequisite for everything else
- Networking, web, and security concepts are tightly coupled
- Visual mapping is a powerful tool for revealing weak understanding

---

## ❓ Questions
- Which parts of this flow are most commonly attacked or misconfigured?
- Where exactly do firewalls, WAFs, and CDNs intervene in the process?
- What level of detail is necessary to explain this clearly to a non-technical person?

---

## 🧩 One-Sentence Summary
A website works because a browser resolves a domain name to an IP address, establishes a network connection to a server, sends an HTTP request, and receives a response that it processes and displays.
