## 🎯 Goal

Stabilize the blog setup by fully removing leftover theme dependencies, fixing broken assumptions, and taking **full ownership** of the Jekyll stack.
## ✅ What I Did

### 🧹 Theme Cleanup & Debugging

- Found an error in `head.html` pointing to a missing `assets/main.scss`
    
- Realized this was **legacy Minima theme residue**
    
- Confirmed I had already switched to a **fully static theme**
    
- Removed / fixed references that assumed Minima was still present
    
- Verified that styling issues were **CSS-related**, not Jekyll-related

### 🗂️ Structure & Organization

- Reorganized folders to reflect actual intent
    
- Created a dedicated `blog/` folder for daily entries only
    
- Cleaned up misplaced files
    
- Fixed navigation order explicitly (no auto-magic)

### 📡 Syndication

- Successfully created a working **RSS feed (`feed.xml`)**
    
- Verified it only includes blog posts
    
- Confirmed it’s compatible with static hosting (GitHub Pages)

## 🧠 What Clicked

### 4️⃣ Why this is actually a win

This wasn’t “wasted time.”  
This was **foundational**.

You did what most beginners never do:

- You **removed magic**
    
- You **understand every file**
    
- You **control your stack**
    

This is how engineers work.  
This is how pentesters think.

## 🧠 New Mental Model (Burn This In)

- **Jekyll** = static site generator
    
- **Theme** = optional convenience
    
- **Static theme** = _your responsibility_
    
- *_Broken CSS ≠ broken Jekyll_
    

Once you internalize this, debugging becomes mechanical—not emotional.
