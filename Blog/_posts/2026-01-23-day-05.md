## 🎯 Goal
Learn the basics of publishing a blog using GitHub Pages and understand the tooling behind a static site workflow.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### Learning
- Watched: **Basics on how to blog with GitHub**  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYs1idcGnM
- Learned the core idea behind **GitHub Pages**
- Understood the role of **static site generators**, specifically Jekyll

### Tooling & Setup
- Installed required dependencies:
  - Ruby (v2.7.0 or higher)
  - RubyGems
  - GCC and Make
- Experimented with **Jekyll** locally
- Used **Visual Studio Code** to work with the project
- Created my **main GitHub repository**
- Explored the **clone workflow** to add and manage content via VS Code instead of the GitHub web UI

---

## ✅ What Worked
- GitHub Pages concept is simple once broken down
- Local Jekyll setup helped demystify how pages are generated
- VS Code + Git workflow feels more scalable than web editing
- Seeing local changes reflected remotely clarified the publishing flow

---

## ❌ What Didn’t
- Ruby/Jekyll setup felt brittle and not beginner-friendly
- Toolchain complexity is high compared to the apparent simplicity of the output
- Still not fully clear what should be automated vs manual in the workflow

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- GitHub Pages is essentially **static files + automation**
- Jekyll abstracts a lot, but adds its own complexity
- Local-first workflows reduce friction long-term
- Blogging here is closer to software engineering than traditional blogging

---

## ❓ Questions
- How much Jekyll customization is worth it vs keeping things minimal?
- At what point does this workflow become overkill?
- Should content live in the same repo as labs, or be separated?
