## 🎯 Goal

Deepen Linux fundamentals by working with **remote access, filesystem operations, and permissions**, focusing on skills directly transferable to real systems.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### TryHackMe

- Completed **Linux Fundamentals Part 2**
    

### Remote Access

- Connected to a remote Linux machine using **SSH**
    
- Understood SSH as a core skill for administration and pentesting
    

### Command Line Usage

- Used command **flags and switches** to extend functionality
    
- Consulted **`man` pages** and `--help` for self-documentation
    

### Filesystem Operations

- Created files and directories (`touch`, `mkdir`)
    
- Copied and moved files (`cp`, `mv`)
    
- Deleted files and folders (`rm`, `rm -R`)
    
- Identified file types using `file`
    

### Permissions & Users

- Learned Linux permission model:
    
    - Read / Write / Execute (`rwx`)
        
    - Numeric permissions (`755`, `644`, `700`)
        
- Explored ownership:
    
    - User
        
    - Group
        
    - Others
        
- Switched users with:
    
    - `su`
        
    - `su -l`
        

### System Directories

- Reviewed key directories:
    
    - `/etc` – configuration and credentials
        
    - `/var` – logs and variable data
        
    - `/root` – root user home
        
    - `/tmp` – writable temporary directory
        

---

## ✅ What Worked

- SSH usage finally feels practical, not abstract
    
- Man pages reduced reliance on copy-pasting commands
    
- Numeric permissions started to make sense
    
- Filesystem navigation feels more deliberate
    

---

## ❌ What Didn’t

- `grep` syntax still causes friction
    
- `rm -R` is powerful enough to be dangerous
    
- Permissions require repetition to become instinctive
    

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- SSH is foundational to almost everything in Linux security
    
- Flags + man pages turn basic commands into powerful tools
    
- Linux permissions are a **security boundary**, not just syntax
    
- Understanding `/etc` and `/var` is critical for real-world analysis
    
- `/tmp` stands out as a frequent point of interest in attacks
    

---

## ❓ Questions

- When should `su` be preferred over `sudo`?
    
- What are the most common real-world permission misconfigurations?
    
- How often is `/tmp` abused in actual pentests?

### Personal Objective (Why This Exists)

- ⬜ Build solid **Linux operational confidence**
    
- ⬜ Reduce reliance on copy-paste commands
    
- ⬜ Prepare for real-world lab environments
    
- ⬜ Strengthen foundations for privilege escalation later
