#  From Zero to Cybersecurity


This repository documents my journey into cybersecurity over the next **7/8 months** or so, for now.

Not a bootcamp.
Not a motivational diary.

This is a **public, structured learning log** where I document:
- what I study
- what I build
- what I break
- what I misunderstand
- and what I eventually learn to do *properly*

---

## 🎯 The Goal

By the end of these 7 months, my objective is to:
- have **solid fundamentals** in networking, Linux, web technologies, and security
- complete and **properly document at least 10 penetration tests**
- hopefully be **junior-level hireable** in cybersecurity or close
- demonstrate the ability to *think* in this complicated field and not just run tools

I’m not aiming to be an expert.
I’m aiming to be **useful, honest, and employable** — with room to grow.

---

## 🧭 How I’m Approaching This

I’m focusing on:
- **Foundations first** (networking, how the web works, Linux, protocols)
- **Hands-on labs** (TryHackMe, practical exercises, controlled environments)
- **Documentation** (clear notes, diagrams, reports, and reflections)
- **Understanding flows**, not memorizing definitions
- **Visual thinking** (diagrams, maps, failure scenarios)

Every day is logged.
Every assumption gets challenged.
Every gap gets written down instead of ignored.

## 📁 Repository Structure

You’ll find:
- **Daily logs** — what I studied and what actually stuck
- **Labs** — practical exercises and walkthroughs
- **Reports** — structured write-ups (increasingly pentest-style)
- **Diagrams & notes** — how I make sense of complex systems
- **Portfolio material** — things I’d be comfortable showing a recruiter

Nothing here is polished for show.
It’s polished for **clarity** or at least it tries to be.

## 🤝 Feedback Is Welcome (Seriously)

If you’re more experienced and you see:
- bad assumptions
- weak mental models
- inefficient approaches
- things I should stop doing or start doing sooner

Please comment, open an issue, or say something.

I’d much rather be corrected early than confidently wrong later.

If you’re at a similar stage, feel free to follow along, compare notes, or steal the structure.

## ⚠️ A Small Disclaimer

This repository is:
- not a tutorial
- not security advice
- not a checklist for shortcuts

It’s a **learning process**, my learning process, in public, with mistakes included (lots of them).

---

## 🚀 Why Public?

Because:
- accountability beats motivation
- documentation forces understanding
- pretending to know things helps no one

If this helps someone else learn, great.
Hopefully it will help me stay honest and disciplined.

Let’s see where this goes.
